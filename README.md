# My Personal Website/Portfolio

This is the code for my personal website which will be regularly updated with new projects, tech demos and anything random I happen to work on.

## The website
Currently this website is being hosted at [joshuapinti.com](https://joshuapinti.com/) which if it wasn't clear enough, is just my name.
At current only the front page is partially done, mainly because the planet floating in the background took so long to do. Which the code for is also available.
I do have plans to have more such as a page to play around with the settings for this planet as well as a few other technologies I've been working with such as P2P websockets will be coming soon.

## Charity is Appreciated
I'm currently a university student studying Computer Engineering so I'm just a wee bit broke so any [donations](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/joshuapinti) for any reason is much appreciated.
